# IntpTrtRule

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of IntpTrtRule is to construct treatment rules in the form of decision trees. The algorithm models the conditional average treatment effects for each individual as a function of covariates. The complexity of a tree is determined by the maximum depth of the tree, the minimum number of observations in each leave node. More conditions to control the complexity of a tree can be added.
